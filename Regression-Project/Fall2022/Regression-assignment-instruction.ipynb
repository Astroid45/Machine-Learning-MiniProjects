    "In this programming assignment you will be training and programming **4** algorithms to predict the house prices for Boston homes. The four models you'll be using are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linear regression using <u>ordinary least squared</u> method.\n",
    "2. Linear regression using <u>least mean squares</u> method.\n",
    "3. Polynomial regression using <u>ordinary least squares</u>\n",

    "This mini-project will work similarly to the labs where there are TODOs you must complete. Be on the lookout for **TODO** tags - they guide you towards what needs to be done. However, unlike the labs, most of the coding will now be left to you and there will be less direct instructions. The goal of this mini-project is for you to practice what your learned in the labs on your own! \n"

    "- **Even though scikit-learn contains LinearRegression, PolynomialRegression classes, you should be implementing your own algorithms instead of using the machine learning MODEL packaged in library**. This will be reviewed before the final grading. These include libraries such as NumPy and Pandas. However, keep in mind the above constraints on importing plotting libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Epochs (number of iterations of data)**: While training your models locally, you can keep this number as high as you want. But please keep in mind, that for evaluation your job will have a maximum of **3 minutes** to finish training and prediction for all the three algorithms. So tune this parameter, keeping this information in mind. "
